[Snakemake][] workflow for analysis and assembly of viral genomes from IonTorrent AmpliSeq data.

## Overview

- Preprocessing

    - Duplicate reads were removed using [Picard][]
    - Reads were trimmed with [Trimmomatic][] prior to [SPAdes][] assembly
    - BAM file stats computed using [Samtools][] (coverage depth, extent, extent per genome, # of reads mapped)

- Reference Genome Selection

    - Downloading of all Classical swine fever virus ([CSFV][]) (or FMDV, Ebola, Zika) virus genomes from [NCBI Entrez API][] using [BioPython][]
    - [Mash][] screen of deduplicated reads against all reference genomes with sketch size of 10000 and sketch k-mer size of 16, sorting by Mash screen identity to find top reference genome for read mapping and variant calling

- Read Mapping & Variant Calling

    - Read mapping with [BWA MEM][]
    - Removal of duplicate reads with [Samtools][]
    - Variant calling with [FreeBayes][]
    - [SnpEff][] was used to predict and report variant effects using reference genome annotation

- De Novo Assembly
    - [SPAdes][] de novo assembly of trimmed deduplicated reads.
    - [QUAST][] quality assessment of assemblies

- Quality Control

    - [MultiQC][] interactive report of [FastQC][], [Samtools][], [QUAST][], [SnpEff][]

- Phylogenetic Tree

    - Phylogenetic tree constructed with [IQ-TREE][] (or [Clearcut][] if a quick and dirty tree is okay)
    - Interactive HTML phylogenetic tree visualization with [PhyloCanvas][] using [shiptv][]

## Usage

### Step 0: Install pre-requisites

Running this workflow with [Singularity][] is recommended, but you can use [Conda][] if you prefer. The Singularity image will come with all the dependencies bundled together in a single file. 

#### Install [Singularity][] (recommended)

Follow the instructions for installing Singularity [here](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.3/user-guide/quick_start.html#quick-start)

#### Setup and activate the [Conda] environment if not using [Singularity][] (optional)

Install [Conda] if you haven't already following [these instructions](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and setup the [BioConda channel](https://bioconda.github.io/user/install.html#set-up-channels).

Download or `git clone` this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterk87/viral-ampliseq-assembly.git
cd viral-ampliseq-assembly
# create a conda environment named "viral-ampliseq-assembly-1.0.0"
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate viral-ampliseq-assembly-1.0.0
# install snakemake into this env
conda install -y snakemake
# run Snakemake on the test directory
snakemake --directory test/
```

### Step 1: Install workflow

If you simply want to use this workflow, download and extract the [latest release](https://github.com/peterk87/viral-ampliseq-assembly/releases).
If you intend to modify and further develop this workflow, fork this repository. Please consider providing any generally applicable modifications via a pull request.

In any case, if you use this workflow in a paper, don't forget to give credits to the authors by citing the URL of this repository and, if available, its DOI (see above).


### Step 2: Configure workflow

Create an analysis directory, copy and modify the example `config.yaml` and `samples.tsv` files to suit your needs. 

e.g.

```
mkdir ~/my-ampliseq-analysis
cp viral-ampliseq-assembly/config.yaml ~/my-ampliseq-analysis/
cp viral-ampliseq-assembly/samples.tsv ~/my-ampliseq-analysis/
```

Edit your `config.yaml` as needed.

Add sample entries to your `samples.tsv`

```
sample  bam_file
Sample1 bams/Sample1.bam
Sample2 bams/Sample2.bam
Sample3 bams/Sample3.bam
... <more sample entries>
```
where `bam_file` can be the relative or absolute path to a sample's BAM file.


#### [IQ-TREE] maximum-likelihood or [Clearcut] RNJ tree

In your `config.yaml` the `fast_tree` parameter controls which method (ML or RNJ) is used for phylogenetic tree construction.

If you want a quick and dirty tree, set

```yaml
fast_tree: true
```

in your `config.yaml` to generate a Relaxed Neighbor Joining (RNJ) tree.

Otherwise, if you want a high accuracy phylogenetic tree and are willing to wait for it, then set

```yaml
fast_tree: false
```

to use [IQ-TREE] to generate a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps (UFBoot) (see [Minh et al., 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/molbev/mst024) for more info on UFBoot).

### Step 3: Execute workflow

*If you do not have [Singularity] installed then remove the `--use-singularity` flag*

Test your configuration by performing a dry-run via

    snakemake --use-singularity -n

Execute the workflow locally via

    snakemake --use-singularity --cores $N

using `$N` cores or run it in a cluster environment via

    snakemake --use-singularity --cluster qsub --jobs 100

or

    snakemake --use-singularity --drmaa --jobs 100

See the [Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io) for further details.

## Testing

Tests cases are in the subfolder `test`. They should be executed via continuous integration with Travis CI.
